      `I've been playing around with Linux and OS level technology since I was 13 years old. I started working as Helpdesk technician a few years ago and from there on I never stopped learning and building up both my skills and m carreer.`,
      `After learning JavaScript, NodeJS and using Typescript, I understood that being a full time coder wasn't for me and that iI was really attracted about the entire architecture behind the code, so I started toying around with Docker and luckily enough I had the chance of using it in our production environment after only 6 months.`,
      `Now I'm a DevOps Engineer at Fincons and working as a freelance on different projects collaborating on the foundation of a clean development workflow to allow correct use of Version Control, Microservices Architecture and CI/CD Pipelines.`,
